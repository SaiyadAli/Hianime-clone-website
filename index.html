                    some are better than the rest, so we've decided to build HiAnime.to to be one of the best free
                    anime streaming site for all anime fans on the world.</p>

                    trying to make it the safest site for free anime.</p>

                <h2>3/ So what make HiAnime.to the best site to watch anime free online?</h2>
                <p>Before building HiAnime.to, we've checked many other free anime sites, and learnt from them. We
                    only keep the good things and remove all the bad things from all the competitors, to put it
                    in our HiAnime website. Let's see how we're so confident about being the best site for anime
                    streaming:</p>
